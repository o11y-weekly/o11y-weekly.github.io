Welcome to o11y weekly (observability weekly!).

Here is the latest news / feedbacks about observability.

This week, I made the same demo than [the previous post](./2024-01-31_OpenTelemetry_Looks_Good_To_Me/README.md) but for dotnet with OpenTelemetry and Grafana Labs products LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo and Mimir) : [OpenTelemetry Looks Good To Me for dotnet](./2024-02-28_OpenTelemetry_Looks_Good_To_Me_dotnet/README.md). You will discover with a docker compose demo an example of what could be OpenTelemetry and Grafana Labs apply to java applications.
